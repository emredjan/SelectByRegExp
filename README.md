## SelectByRegExp

Plugin for [fman.io](https://fman.io) that allows you to select files in the current pane based on a regular expression.

Install by uploading "SelectByRegExp" to your [data directory](https://fman.io/docs/customizing-fman)`/Plugins`.

### Usage

When you press **Shift+m** (I'm using my Vim Keymappings), Fman will ask for a regular expression. Once you give one, it will select files in the current directory that matches the regular expression.

### Features

 - Select files based on regular expressions.
